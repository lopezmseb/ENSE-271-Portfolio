# ENSE 271 Portfolio
## Welcome to my portfolio!
My name is Sebastian Lopez Melendrez. I am a second-year student in Software Engineering.
This is a showcase of all different lab projects I've worked on this semester.
These projects include:
- User Story Mapping
- Bar Willow Documentation (Asset Inventory and Sitemap)
- Low Fidelity Figma Recreation
- High Fidelity Figma Prototype
- Personal Wordpress Site

## User Story Mapping
Inside the User Story Mapping folder, you'll find a collection of pictures showcasing my entire User Story Map, as well as some of the details within those cards.

## Bar Willow Documentation
As part of our class, we were asked to find a website to document. I chose Bar Willow Eatery and produced documenation for two things:
- An Asset Inventory
- A Site Map

Inside the folder, you'll be able to find those two pieces of documentation.

## Low Fidelity Wireframing (Figma)
As part of our class, we were asked to find a design from [Dribble]("https://dribbble.com/") and recreate it using only Figma features. Inside the folder, you'll find both the Figma file as well as an image showcasing the recreation.

**Note**: To view the .fig file, you will be required to use the [Figma]("https://www.figma.com/") application. This will require you create an account and install the app.

## High Fidelity Prototype (Figma)

As part of our class, we were asked to use Figma to create a High-Fidelity Prototype. Inside the folder, you'll be able to find a PDF containing all major pages of our prototype (and Components used), as well as the .fig file to try it yourself.

## Word Press Site (Personal)
As part of our class, we were asked to create a WordPress site using the Starter Templates plugin. I chose to create a Personal Site. Inside the folder, you'll be able to find images showcasing the site.
